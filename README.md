# TicketToRide-Polytech

This repository is linked to the Coding Game Server, and the game Ticket-to-ride.
The goal of this server is to host programming contest, for my students.

So this repository contains the necessary files and instructions to participate to this contest (Fall 2020).
It is now restricted to the students of the engineering school Polytech Sorbonne, but you can of course host your own !
Feel free to contact me (thibault.hilaire@lip6.fr) if you want to have more details or if you want to organize one for your student
(The language used is C, and the students need to be ease with pointers, dynamic allocation memory and some advanced algorithmic, like graphs)
